        "# YouTube Playlist to Tip Repository\n",
        "\n",
        "As an avid music producer, I identified a common challenge in the creative process: the disruption of workflow when seeking quick tips from lengthy tutorial videos. To address this, I spearheaded an innovative project to streamline access to valuable production advice. Drawing inspiration from Ableton's One Thing series, which features diverse genre producers sharing creative tips, I developed a script to transcribe and translate video content into accessible text. This script not only transcribes but also intelligently translates content where needed, ensuring universal accessibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "To elevate the utility of these transcriptions, I integrated them with OpenAI's GPT model for fine-tuning and enhancing the tips, providing succinct, relevant, and context-rich advice. The culmination of this project is a user-friendly app, seamlessly integrated into Ableton's Max for Live. This integration ensures that invaluable tips are readily available within the digital audio workstation (DAW), preserving the artistic flow and enhancing the music creation process. This tool not only demonstrates my technical prowess in programming and AI but also reflects a deep understanding of the needs and challenges within the music production community"

One thing that I've found is that sometimes the best thing to sample is the space in between the actual notes. Today I got my keyboard hooked up through some cool reverb and delay pedals to give us a nice tail to mess with. Now instead of using the attack, we're going to go further into the sound and use just the little bit of the tail where all the cool fuzz and texture is. By then taking this little piece of the tail into a simpler, we have a really interesting ethereal sounding pad. This trick can also be applied to drums. Sometimes I'll take a drum break and delete all the actual hits, just leaving the space in between the drums. I can then take those little bits of ambience and add more texture to my own drum sounds. Once it all comes together, these subtle things are really what help the whole groove sing.\\n\\n\",\n",

And while playing the same MIDI pattern, this will radically change the way the sample plays back. Let's hear how that sounds. I like to capture all these ideas into an audio clip on another track.

And one thing I like to do when I'm in the studio with the Glitch Mob is to create a narrative for our songs. So here's an old version of our song Head Full of Shadows. When we came up with this section it reminded us of a chase scene from the video game Prince of Persia. Then we came up with this intro where the feeling is sad and maybe the princess is captured but at the same time the arpeggio gives the feeling that something is about to happen. In this bridge section we envisioned the prince infiltrating the camp knocking out the guards and stealthily making his way to the princess's tent. When we think of music as a narrative in this way, it helps us to turn our songs into stories. We turn our songs into stories with Edit\\n\\n\",\n",

First I'll load up a drum kit and create a one bar long MIDI note on C1 in a new clip. Next I'll drop the Chord MIDI effect on the track so that OneNote in the clip generates a bunch of notes. Then I'll add the arpeggiator to sequence those notes over time, altering the style for completely unique results. On a synth this would sound like arpeggios, but with drums and percussion this is a great way to generate complex rhythms that I might never imagine myself. Now, let's add some more.

A volte mi trovo con un riff midi che mi piace, che però necessita di variazione e movimento. Quindi per prima cosa prendo questo riff midi, lo faccio entrare in una traccia audio e lo registro. Quando ho il mio sample audio inserisco una serie di effetti, delay, beat repeater o quello che mi ispira al momento, per rendere il suono più stratificato e interessante. Dopo frizzo la traccia audio e applico l'opzione converti melodie in una nuova traccia midi. Ottenuto il nuovo midi mi assicuro che sia nella stessa scala del brano, inserendo il device scale nella tonalità corretta. Il nuovo pattern può essere un ottimo aggiunto a variazione, oppure può fungere da contrapunto alla melodia originale. Se non sono ancora soddisfatto del risultato ottenuto, inserisco sezioni del nuovo pattern in quello originale e ripeto l'intero processo. Lavorare con una certa dose di casualità rende i miei pattern più interessanti, meno prevedibili e meno umani, e mi aiuta a trovare nuovi pattern melodici, suonando non avrei mai pensato. Per ottenere più informazioni sui pattern, iscriviti al canale e attiva la campanella. Grazie per la visione!\\n\\n\",\n",

The tempo of this song is 74 BPM, and the key is A minor. I used this free online tool to enter the tempo, and how many semitones I'd like to transpose while recording. And I see that I have to record at 55.437 BPM. I set live to this tempo, and switch all audio clips to re-pitch mode to handle the transposition to E minor automatically. When I got a feel for the new key and tempo, I start recording. When finished, I make sure the recorded audio is in re-pitch mode, and go back to the original tempo. For comparison, this is a vocal track I recorded in the original tempo. And this is the track I just recorded at a slower speed. And this is the track I just recorded at a slower speed. I love this technique, because it allows me to record my voice at a slower speed. And because the sounds feel like they come from a different voice and time. Often I take it even further and apply a formant shifting plugin at the end. For me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me.\\n\\n\",\n",

Sometimes when I write chord progressions, I feel like I'm repeating myself and playing similar patterns over and over again. When that happens, I record whatever progression comes to mind and slice it to the simpler. I play around with the slices until I find an original progression I like. Finally, I replay this on my guitar and record it. Playing an instrument for many years can make it easy to get stuck in habits and patterns.

Per la registrazione iniziale uso la mia voce con più sfumature e variazioni possibili. Per esempio inserendo dei glissati o aggiungendo rumori ritmici o respiri. Unisco le tracce di voce in un gruppo e trascino l'autofilter. Poi creo una traccia MIDI per controllare l'autofilter tramite esaminare. E inserisco il sidechain. Scrivo un pattern MIDI. E inserisco un suono di organo senza release. E muto la traccia. Ora torno sull'autofilter, clicco sul triangolo, attivo il sidechain e scelgo come sorgente l'audio della mia traccia MIDI. Imposto l'invigliamento. Sviluppo al massimo, attacco e release al minimo, chiudo il cutoff e imposto il gain finché la traccia MIDI controllerà il filtro. Torno indietro e cambio facilmente il pattern ritmico modificando le note MIDI. Infine torno sulle impostazioni dell'autofilter e provo differenti regolazioni. Per esempio muovendo la frequenza. O sovrapponendo un altro elemento ritmico usando la quadra dell'LFO in sync mode. Usare l'autofilter in questo modo è molto più versatile del gate. Mi permette di esplorare differenti texture vocali in modo creativo. Inoltre, il score a mini grafone si sa che contribuisce ainstrumentale e a risultati unici.

So in order to make sure I'm in the right frame of mind before I begin, I'll do a lot of research around the subject, read the script, watch the film, before composing any music at all and then I'll leave it. I'll step away from it for a while. I trust my subconscious so I know that when I do come back and sit down, I'm in the right headspace.

First I load a sine wave into Simpler. I set a short decay time and add a high pass filter. Usually I cut around 1.2 kHz but this depends on the mix. Then I add a chorus, just the default settings.

I start by importing some tracks I love. They don't have to fit each other and it doesn't matter if they fit my style. One sample will be my reference and I adapt tempo and tuning of the other ones. If the key of the reference is D major, I tune all major tracks to D major and all minor tracks to the related minor tune B minor. I layer the tracks and cut everything that's unnecessary until I have a nice, complex loop. I listen or jam to it and at some point I'll discover a hidden chord progression, a melody line or a rhythm for my own track. The loop itself won't end up in my final track, but it helps me to come up with new ideas.\\n\\n\",\n",

I also draw in automation and add different effects. Next, I send one of the tracks to some effects pedals, start recording, and tweak some parameters. I treat this audio the same way and delete what I don't want to hear. Finally, I turn up the volume to hear all of the sounds I have to work with, and continue to edit the material using my ears. This strategy helps spark new ideas that energize my creativity. The unpredictability always surprises me.

I enable Follow Actions, and set Follow Action A to Other. I set the clips to Unlinked, and the time to 1 beat. Now, after every beat, Live will trigger a randomly selected clip on my vocal track. To make things more interesting, I duplicate certain clips, and alter their pitch. If I switch on Legato, the clip will play from its last stopped point, and creates a more fluid sounding vocal chop. In the end, I re-sample the vocal track, so that I can save the generated pattern of chops.

If you start thinking of your bass drum as a bass note it is obvious that you would like to make it fit with the rest. Now tuning kicks is a bit tricky because the tonal structure is hard to hear in the lower frequencies.

È una cosa che mi piace fare e registrare tutte le improvvisazioni e le mie idee in un unico progetto. Quando voglio improvvisare o lavorare una nuova composizione, apro il mio liveset, chiamato Sketchbook. Il progetto contiene tracce audio per tutti i miei synth, una traccia MIDI per un plugin di 303 e tracce di ritorno per riverbero e delay. Tutti i take sono organizzati in scene. Per iniziare una jam, creo una nuova scena e registro. C'è anche un canale audio per registrare altri strumenti. In questo modo posso collegare una chitarra o un microfono al volo e registrare. Quando ho fatto, rinomino le scene, assegno un colore che rispecchia il mood e segno il BPM. Rinomino le clip per ricordare quello che ho registrato e il BPM. E setto il giusto livello delle mandate grazie alle automazioni sulle clip. Quando voglio riascoltare le mie idee qualche giorno dopo, non ho bisogno di ricordarmi quale progetto contiene quell'idea. Apro solo il progetto Sketchbook. Posso cercare le jam grazie ai colori. Per esempio il verde chiaro corrisponde a sonorità acid, verde scuro per le scene dub, ambiente celeste, e il verde per le scene che sono le mie idee. In grigio invece le cose che non mi piacciono molto. Tutto è warpato. Posso suonare liberamente e combinare clip differenti. Per esempio batterie fatte a gennaio e una sequenza synth fatta a giugno. Avere tutti i miei take in un solo posto mi permette di non avere numerosi progetti non finiti.

So I have a pattern here that's snapped directly to the grid. If I want to create a little bit of smear between the notes and these chords, I drag in a groove file. It doesn't matter which one, because I'm not using the timing offset at all. I apply it to the clip, and then I turn up the randomization amount. So if I turn it up to 100, it kind of falls apart. It sounds like I programmed this drunk. But I find that if I use about 10%, I get a nice offset between the notes and the chords. Often what I'll do is duplicate the track then, and take the groove off the second version, and then pan them a little bit. So then I get this offset between where they are in the stereo field, and also between the strictly quantized and the randomized version.

When I'm back, I'll layer the samples with other sounds like synths, clean instrument samples or fill recordings to create unique textures. Using these sounds helps me to stay open-minded, to think beyond chord progression and keys and to make the process of creating limitless. Fun fact, I have a Robert set-up where I can record items as qualquer 1962 was coming my way.

First, I go outside with my phone to capture foley sounds. These can be rocks, trees, shells, anything I can strike or rustle. Now in Live, I drag my recordings onto a new audio track, right-click and turn off my grid, and split the audio clips to separate my favorite parts. When I'm done, I open up a blank sampler, highlight the clips I divided, and drag them in. Then, I click on the Zone tab to find the green Key Editor, select All, and drag both sides to the middle to the letter R. I have 10 samples, so I click on the bottom zone and use the right arrow key to move it to the 10th space. This way, when I right-click and select Distribute Ranges Equally, all 10 samples are assigned to their own MIDI note. Now, in the MIDI tab, I set the velocity destination to Pitch, and set the velocity amount to around 50% so softer taps feel deeper, and harder taps feel brighter. To take it one step further, I can also select Time as the destination and set it to 100% to play the speed of the envelopes. It becomes very noticeable when I bring the Sustain all the way down and shorten the Decay. Finally, for a nice stereo effect, I set the Random Pan percentage just above 10%, and now it's starting to fly around my ears. Now, it's starting to fly around my ears.

First, I open this website and type in a fundamental frequency. I usually pick a frequency below 200 Hz. The site displays the corresponding overtone series and I write it down. Then, I create the harmonic series in Live, using Operator to generate sine waves. Next, I play with the balance and automate the levels, creating a progression. I often duplicate some of the partials and slightly detune them to create a beating. As a final step, I replace some of the sine waves with recordings of tunable instruments.

So here's the raw signal from this synth with no delay. I put the delay at 100% wet and the feedback all the way down, just hearing one instance of the delay. And as I bring the delay time up, it's going to get grittier and a bit noisier. And finally, I adjust the modulation, which moves the delay time and makes the pitch sway subtly. I can do the same thing with a software delay. I turn it to 100% wet and the feedback to zero, so that I'm just getting a single instance. I turn up the frequency of the delay and I switch the delay division to something quick, like 32nd or 64th notes. I turn up the wobble on the noise, sometimes a little bit of reverb. And finally, I use the filter to shape the frequency spectrum a bit. I love this technique because it gives the original signal, a feeling of age and degradation.\\n\\n\",\n",

This slightly alters the formants again, so I adjust the formant parameter to keep the current vibe, or even get closer to what I want.

            " Ciao, mi chiamo Mattia e una cosa che mi piace fare è trasformare le tracce midi in audio, applicare degli effetti e poi trasformarle in midi così da ottenere nuovi riff. A volte mi trovo con un riff midi che mi piace, che però necessita di variazione e movimento. Quindi per prima cosa prendo questo riff midi, lo faccio entrare in una traccia audio e lo registro. Quando ho il mio sample audio inserisco una serie di effetti, delay, beat repeater o quello che mi ispira al momento, per rendere il suono più stratificato e interessante. Dopo frizzo la traccia audio e applico l'opzione converti melodie in una nuova traccia midi. Ottenuto il nuovo midi mi assicuro che sia nella stessa scala del brano, inserendo il device scale nella tonalità corretta. Il nuovo pattern può essere un ottimo aggiunto a variazione, oppure può fungere da contrapunto alla melodia originale. Se non sono ancora soddisfatto del risultato ottenuto, inserisco sezioni del nuovo pattern in quello originale e ripeto l'intero processo. Lavorare con una certa dose di casualità rende i miei pattern più interessanti, meno prevedibili e meno umani, e mi aiuta a trovare nuovi pattern melodici, suonando non avrei mai pensato. Per ottenere più informazioni sui pattern, iscriviti al canale e attiva la campanella. Grazie per la visione!\n",

Now instead of using the attack, we're going to go further into the sound and use just the little bit of the tail where all the cool fuzz and texture is. By then taking this little piece of the tail into a simpler, we have a really interesting ethereal sounding pad. This trick can also be applied to drums. Sometimes I'll take a drum break and delete all the actual hits, just leaving the space in between the drums. I can then take those little bits of ambience and add more texture to my own drum sounds.

Today I got my keyboard hooked up through some cool reverb and delay pedals to give us a nice tail to mess with. Now instead of using the attack, we're going to go further into the sound and use just the little bit of the tail where all the cool fuzz and texture is. By then taking this little piece of the tail into a simpler, we have a really interesting ethereal sounding pad. This trick can also be applied to drums. Sometimes I'll take a drum break and delete all the actual hits, just leaving the space in between the drums. I can then take those little bits of ambience and add more texture to my own drum sounds. Once it all comes together, these subtle things are really what help the whole groove sing.\"],\n",

After recording for 15 to 30 minutes I select and edit the most interesting parts. It can be a loop, a drum sound or the whole jam. Then I export the results and delete the original recordings.

Use warp to match the tempo that matches the video. Then I create a sonic groove and finally add other instruments. And then we will complete it.

If I want to create a little bit of smear between the notes and these chords, I drag in a groove file. It doesn't matter which one, because I'm not using the timing offset at all. I apply it to the clip, and then I turn up the randomization amount. So if I turn it up to 100, it kind of falls apart. It sounds like I programmed this drunk. But I find that if I use about 10%, I get a nice offset between the notes and the chords. Often what I'll do is duplicate the track then, and take the groove off the second version, and then pan them a little bit. So then I get this offset between where they are in the stereo field, and also between the strictly quantized and the randomized version. And this is a nice way to get a little life back into these patterns without having to do a lot of work. Thanks for watching! I'll see you guys in the next video!\"],\n",

              "  \"Hey, I'm Mike. One thing I've found is that auditioning random loops from an unquantized sample can be a great way of sparking ideas to start a song. I'll start by recording myself playing bass for a few minutes. Then I'll go back and select one or two bar phrases with arbitrary start points to see how they sound. I'll also record the rest of the song. In my experience, the best ideas come out when you take a step back and let the magic happen. And this technique is a great way of letting the chord progressions write themselves. traveler A b u w s e m a b l d y c p s o\"],\n",

              "  \"Hey I'm Nina and one thing I like to do is use field recordings to add texture to my drums. I start by recording ambient sounds. I'm mostly interested in textures with an organic quality. When I'm back, I open the audio file in Simpler, chop it up in slice mode, and copy my MIDI drum clip to this track so that each drum note triggers a different slice. Finally, I adjust the transient detection sensitivity, transpose the MIDI, and play with filter and envelope settings until I hear something I like. I'm using the Simpler to add a layer of sound to my drum. Layering sounds from the outside world makes my drums less predictable and it helps me to glue my arrangements together.\"],\n",

I love doing feed recording, but walking without a precise plan often doesn't seem very productive. When I focus on something concrete, like rhythmic sounds, I have more ideas about what to look for. Suddenly I find all kinds of rhythms. Fast, slow, surprising or obvious. Back in the studio, select my favorites. I start exploring them through looping, reverse, pitching and adding effects.

              "  \"Hi, I'm Roman, and one thing I like to do is create polyrhythms in Live's Arrangement view. First, I start with some empty tracks. I shorten the loop bar to half a bar and the rack to a 32nd. Then, I take some drum samples, bring them to the beginning of the track, and cut the long samples to about a 16th. I select a section a little longer than the first sample and duplicate it repeatedly with command D until the loop fills. I do the same with the next sample, selecting a different start, defining the rhythm with the coexistence of starts. To create more complex rhythms or different meters, I change the grid to triplets. Finally, I move the samples around and mute some until I'm happy with the result. I like this method because it increases my listening and helps me create grooves that are interesting, bodily, and good starting points for building entire tracks.

It's a track that's called The Feels. Let's take a listen to it. Now I decided to make an IDM track called The Feels. By naming my track in advance, the first thing that I know that I needed is I needed to have something that was emotional. I started with a chord progression with lush and ambient pads and once I had that going, I then added in a reggae guitar to give it even more of an organic vibe. The benefits of using this technique are it narrows my focus, it makes my sound design more cohesive and on top of that, it allows me to be more creative and have more fun and ultimately that's what it's all about.

              "  \"Hi, I'm Tiffany. One thing I like to do is use follow actions to discover inspiring chord progressions. I keep a MIDI library of chords in different keys, so I can easily just drag and drop them into my session. I place the chords in a follow action group. Here I've chosen D minor. I select them all, set the follow action to any, and record the results of these random progressions in arrangement view. So once I have something I like, I'll try out different inversions for smoother voice leading. This method helps me stop focusing just on what technically works, and get in touch with what inspires me. At first I thought a癣D is something that's still simple, simple but wissenable. But you can read up a little later... I've recently started reading music videos. And I know this is all a good way of socializing with music...

Sometimes when I'm writing a track it feels like it's almost there but then I find myself going around in circles trying to finish it by writing extra parts. Maybe the track doesn't need extra parts. Perhaps it only needs little variations here and there. That's where I stop myself and decide to explore these questions in a live situation where I can react instantly to the feedback of the audience. I might change the length or repetitions of parts, vary the lyrics a bit, throw in delays, distort the drums or play with dramatic filtering. This way I find out what works and what doesn't without overthinking it. Me playing an unfinished song live is a breakfast with me. brilliant way to finish a song.
